            <h2>Future Software Developer</h2>

            <p>My name's Daniel Szamosi, I live in Hungary and I have a turtle named TÃ¶ki. In the near future I plan to be a software developer. I'm really interested in soundtracks in gaming, so I'd like to learn more about what triggers a specific song in game applications. I previously worked as a food engineer, so I'd also keen on finding connection between coding and food production. Thanks for being here!</p>
